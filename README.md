# Binary Heap Demo

This is a simple and minimalist demo of a binary heap data structure.

## MaxHeap
The parent is always greater than their children nodes.
Should be used for retrieving max values in O(1) time.

## MinHeap
The parent is always less than their children nodes.
Should be used for retrieving min values in O(1) time.
